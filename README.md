# rename_folder
 
## Usage
```bash
python main.py --PATH_TO_FOLDER --START_COUNT

--PATH_TO_FOLDER: The absolute link to the folder that you want to change the name of the file in the folder
--START_COUNT: maybe you need or no. But if you do not define it, you need to change the code in main.py

```bash
python main.py D:\images 1
```

```bash
python main.py D:\images
```
